# MultiConnector_extension
Gdevelop extension allowing easy use and configuration of THNK protocols **(this is not an official THNK extension)**

**For now many functions are not working properly now, and HELP IS GREATLY WELCOME.** Some are half working, and a game example shows how to use the extension, and the expected result (sometime shown using other functions and not the extension in case it is still bugged).

where to find the MultiConnector_example_game : to be indicated soon...
